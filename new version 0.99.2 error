Hello Just installed the new version of methylkit and i am getting the below error when i try to annotate the differentially methylated regions.  I have been using this for weeks 
and i've not got this error until now with the new version.  However i have changed the read depth to count any sites above 3x.  Please help and many thanks.

commands:
gene.obj <- read.transcript.features(system.file("methylV1", "refseq.mm10.bed.txt", package = "methylKit"))
annotate.WithGenicParts(myDiff25p, gene.obj)

error:
 In .Seqinfo.mergexy(x, y) :
  Each of the 2 combined objects has sequence levels not in the other:
  - in 'x': chrM
  - in 'y': chr1, chr2, chr3, chr4, chr5, chr6, chr7, chr8, chr9, chrY, chr10, chr11, chr12, chr13, chr14, chr15, chr16, chr18, chr19
  Make sure to always combine/compare objects based on the same reference
  genome (use suppressWarnings() to suppress this warning).

Cheers, 
Michy
